<h1>MySQL Help</h1>

MySQL is being made like Oracle. The enterprise edition may be nice if you
can afford it, but much of is not needed if you free and open other solutions.
It seems MySQL from Oracle is on a dead path somewhat. Oracle seems to have
made their own solutions after years of stagnation where Percona and MariaDB
forged ahead. It seems the might be intereseted in MySQL again because Oracle
is too expensive for cloud solutions. One wonders if they will provide database
services with mysql in the cloud and not call it mysql. 


<h2>Cloud and new technologies</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Monyog -- monitoring and displays replication tree, how things are running.
  <li>Continuous backups with binlogs-- <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/point-in-time-recovery-times.html">here<a/.
    <ul>
      <li> Flush binlogs and backup. The last binlog should remain.
      <li> Take backup with binlog position.
      <li> Get the date of the first command from binlog. Get the binlog position.
      <li> Apply all binlogs with start and stop time. The stop time is the
	same as pointin time recovery. Really you should use the start position
	of the backup and the stop time that you want. 
      </ul>
  <li><a href='https://www.mysql.com/products/enterprise/monitor-features.html'>MySQL Enterprise Benefits</a>
  <li> AWS -- list options here. EBs snapshots and NFS snapshots. 

</ul>

<h2>MySQL Sharding or lack thereof</h2>
MySQL Frabric Links -- overall, not very popular. Overall, I don't like it. Sharding done right has to be done per table, in the software layer for the application based on what the most important queries will use most of the time.

<h2> MySQL tools</h2>
Workbench, MySQL enterprise stuff (like monitoring), Oracle MySQL utilities 1.6, MySQL router, 
percona tools, mariadb, ...etc. 

<p>MySQL Routers is usd witjh InnoDB cluster, like Glarea Cluster, to route quweries to the correct server. So if a server goes down it will redirect to
  another. 

<h2>MySQL ReleaseNotes</h2>
<ul>MySQL 5.5 --- a lot of ideas were stolen from Percona after years of doing
  nothing. 
<li>Thread Pool -- enterprise. Should be in standard. Dumb. 
<li> Audit --- should be in stnadard, Dumb. 
<li>pluggable Authentication. This is good. You can define how someone
  autheticates.
<li>Lots of Innodb improvements. adaptive hash, flushing, comncurrency,
  prefech, io threads, being able to set global variables that needed a reboot
  previously.
<li>NDB is released as a separate product. Not sure why. Probably some marketing scheme.
<li>Semisynchronous replication
<li> Lots of other improvements and also depreciations (some were stupid depreciations).
<li>Performance Schema.
  <li>Enhanced show innodb status
</ul>

<uL> 5.6
  <li>MySQL cofig editor.
  <li> stronger encryption options and password options.
  <li> Innodb full text search
  <li> data directory option for create table.
  <li>transportable tablespaces -- lets you export and import innodb tables.
  <li> Move out the undo into its own tablespaces.
  <li> Improcements to engines and internal actions.
  <li> Row level replication can do imagfe control where only the columns
    that change are updated.
  <li>Binary logs are crash safe.
  <li> changes in replication.
  <li>Delayed Replicaiton
  <li> --- check on multiple masters.
  <li>Multiple replication threads for one per database. Not too helpful.
  <li>You can now do explain for insert, update, delete. Question, can you do explain witout permissions to write for IUD.
    <li>Get disagnostics. 
  </ul>

<ul>5.7
  <li>Encrypted connections, password management, account lockout, ssl and rsa,
  <li>ngram and MeCab full-text parser plugins.
  <li>Temporary table space now has its own file.
  <li>InnoDB supports the Transportable Tablespace feature for partitioned InnoDB tables and individual InnoDB table partitions.
  <li> innodb_buffer_pool_size is now dynamic
  <li> Table spaces outside the datadir canhold mutiple tables.
  <li>Support for json documents in json columns with json functions.
  <li>Mutiple triggers
    <li>Multi source replication 
    <li>Group Replication Performance Schema tables.
      <li>Group Replication SQL.
  </ul>
