  <body>
    <h1>MySQL and identifying problems</h1>
    <p>Rules</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emails suck for notifications, alarms, or anything. It is ONLY good as
        a complimentary service. Period. </li>
      <li>All automatic processes should record time, status, action, and on
        which server/service into a database. </li>
      <li>All alarms should be recorded in a database.</li>
      <li>You should have a dashboard for easy viewing of all databases (even a
        thousand of them).</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I usually write one or use my open source one for all companies I
          worked at. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sufficient work has not been done if you can't tell you CEO within 5
        minutes if your 100 servers are good. Nagios and alarming systems don't
        count. Graphing doesn't count. Green and red dots don't count. Live
        status checking of servers is required. Diskspace or intensive status
        checking can be less than one day old. </li>
      <li>Servers should be configured for basic install and automatic
        monitoring, graphing, and stat gathering with Ansible or high quality
        software. Chef and Puppet are has beens. </li>
      <li>Always push software and database schema changes on DIFFERENT days. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Try to push backward compatible changes to the database 2 days
          before software push. </li>
        <li>95% of the time you can do this.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Non destructive changes, like new accounts, new tables/databases or
          approval from higher up can be done any time. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>Setup a Dev/QA/Staging environments just for database testing. Few do
        this and its wrong. </li>
      <li>Setup a stress test environment for your different severs. Nobody does
        this and it wrong.</li>
    </ul>

      to consider</h2>
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nagios</li>
      <li>Graphite and Grafana</li>
      <li>percona monitoring tools and percona toolkit</li>
      <li>datadog</li>
      <li>If you are in the cloud --- check what they have available. </li>
      <li>TODO: we need to add more options here. Add in specific cloud
        monitoring solutions, </li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h2>Tools to consider</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>MySQL Workbench</li>
      <li>Linux tools</li>
      <ul>
        <li>top, iostat, df, free, vmstat, lsof (open files and open ports),
          tcpdump, netstat, ps, sar, nmap, pmap, strace</li>
        <li>other: mytop, mtop, innodbtop, htop</li>
        <li>other: mycli, sqlcheck, looking at /proc</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How does the server look:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Dashboard</li>
        <li>Alarms</li>
        <li>Graphs</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Then connect to it manaully</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Check disk stats with iostats&nbsp; or other software. </li>
        <li>Check with top and mytop. </li>
        <li>Check diskspace with df or others. </li>
        <li>Check memory with mem and swapspace.</li>
        <li>Check errors logs. </li>
        <li>Check slow logs. </li>
        <ul>
          <li>It still stumped, run slow log through analyzer,. </li>
          <li>Reduce long_query_time</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use strace</li>
        <li>Check global variables. Perhaps variables were not loaded from
          my.cnf or they were changed live.&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Show innodb status, show global status, sow global vaiables</li>
        <li>Performance Schema and Information Schema</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Bring up a duplicate server or use a spare slave to run queries on. </li>
      <li>If they cannot connet:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Log in via ssh to that server and see if you can connect with
          anything. MySQL client is good.</li>
        <li>Check authorization and authentication. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>If it is bad queries:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Take the worst queries and run explain on them. </li>
        <li>Do a slow log analysis. </li>
        <li>Check indexes. </li>
        <li>Check the amount of queries running. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>You should be recording show processlist once a minute for the last 48
        hours. Show innodb status and show global stats and show global
        variables might help.&nbsp;</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Look at the info why something happened at 3 am last night, </li>
        <li>It is usually software and NOT the database that is the problem. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>If still in doubt, </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Turn on general log for a few minutes while problem is occuring,.
          This is slow the system down a little, use IO, and the general log
          with grow rapidly. </li>
        <li>And/Or same thing&nbsp; for slow log, make long_query_time 0 seconds
          for a few minutes. </li>
        <li>Analyze them.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
