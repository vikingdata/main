      <li>Downlod and Install</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Link</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Download: https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-LATEST/</li>
          <li>Install:
            https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/installation.html</li>
          <li>NOTE: If you need to install a specific version, make sure you
            install the right version with its install notes. </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Follow instructions. I recommend adding the repositories.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Better yet, Mke your own repository so you can control better how
            your servers install which version of MySQL. </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>MyRocks Engine</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Links:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Percona comes with MyRocks.</li>

        <li>https://db-engines.com/en/system/MongoDB%3BRavenDB%3BRocksDB</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Purpose: High performance, used by facebook, replacement for innodb. </li>
      <li>It is a key-value store like mongo.</li>
      <li>Adv:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Faster, compressed data, etc.</li>
        <li>Acid -- this isn't talk about much. It seems to be, but I really
          question it. </li>
        <li>transnational</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Limited to available memory. </li>
          <li>read-committed and repeatable-read</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Works with XA</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Dis:</li>
      <ol>
        <li>Be very very careful how you setup, tables, run multi-row
          transactions, etc. It is easy to get non-optimized performance</li>
        <li>No foreign keys</li>
        <li>No full text or spatial keys</li>
        <li>100% rollback??????</li>
        <ol>
          <li>No one talks about this. Disturbing, </li>
          <li>TODO: test this out, test begin commit and rollback. </li>
        </ol>
        <li>100% SQL??????</li>
        <ol>
          <li>Seems to be SQL compliant, but nobody talks about it.</li>
          <li>TODO: perform complicated queries. </li>
        </ol>
        <li>Online DDL not supported yet.</li>
      </ol>
      <li>Install: It comes with Percona by default. </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Percona Xtrabackup</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Link :
        https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-xtrabackup</li>
      <li>NOTE: be careful which version you download. Make sure it works with
        our version of MySQL. </li>
      <li>This is the default software for most companies. </li>
      <ul>
        <li>Focus on restoring from backups. </li>
        <li>Diff backups might be nice. </li>
        <li>Backup binlogs, not&nbsp; just the data. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Percona tools</h2>
    <p>Percona has tons of tools that are useful. Some more than others. Years
      ago I wrote tools when some of these tools did not exist. I like most of
      them but</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Checksum is nice ---- but isn't as flexible as I would like it. </li>
      <li>Analyzing slow logs could be pushed a lot farther and doesn't answer
        questions which solve all the problems I have. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>But I am highly impressed with all the tools and I could not have done
      better with most of them,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-toolkit</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Download, install, and study each tool. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Percona monitoring</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Link:
https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management</li>
      <ul>
        <li>It has the download, install, and manual. </li>
      </ul>
      <li>I also recommend:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Nagios</li>
        <li>My own software DAD. </li>
        <li>Graphing software like Ganglia, Graphite,Grafana, etc. </li>
        <li>Mysql Workbench </li>
        <li>Others</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
