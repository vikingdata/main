1. Once you have setup AWS and google so that you can ssh into both systems
   make sure there aren't any firewalls or routing issues preventing you
   from connecting to the systems from home.
2. Run Mongo on ytour AWS and google instances using SSL connection only.
   And run it on a non-standard port.
3. See if you can connect, if not you may have to open ports in AWS and GOOGLE
   to allow connections to those ports.
4. Make sure the ports are open between google and aws, you can connect to
   mongo using the mongo client. BOTH google and aws block off most ports
   and you will have to open them up and ONLY allow a very short range
   of IP addresses, the one at home, and the ones at Google and AWS. Googles
   ip address may changem so you might have to put in a rnage on the AWS side. 

5. Now the easy part.
  a. Setup a two part mongo cluster on AWS.
  b. Setup one secondary on google.
  c. Add the google secdonar to the AWS cluster.
  d. Insert data to the primary on the AWS cluster.
  e. Manually connect to the secdonary on the google server and see if the
     data is there. You may have to submit a command to allow reading
     from sconaries.

To setup SSL, so the same thing but add the instructions on how I setup SSL
in my example.
