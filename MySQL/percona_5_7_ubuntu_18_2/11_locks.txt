11.  Locks, Mutexs, Semaphores
  a. Locks, Mutexs, Semaphores, s-lockm x-lock
    A lock allows only one thread to enter the part that's locked and the lock is not shared with any other processes. Like locking sa row. 

    A mutex is the same as a lock but it can be system wide (shared by multiple processes). Read locks on the same rows. 

    A semaphore does the same as a mutex but allows x number of threads to enter, this can be used for example to limit the number of cpu, io or ram intensive tasks running at the same time. Like limiting concurrecy or resources at a time.


  b. s-lock, x-lock: X-lock is write lock, s-lock is read lock
     Setting lock means give it to me now, might have to wait. 
     Intention means you are trying to lock but aren't doing anything and will wait.
  c. Detecting all locks
     Show status and show engine innodb status.
     Look here for explanation: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/server-status-variables.html
    1. show global status like "%mutex%";

  f. Other locks --- asssume innodb
     table -- tables are locked usually because of a write (MyISAM) or manually
              or schema.
     record locks - rows locks even if no index is used. Based on query.
     gap locks --- if you lock at least two rows, all rows inbetween are locked.
     	 I must use an index.
     next-key :Locks rows above or below rows in index if you select a row to infinity in either direction: select * from TABLe where id > 50. 
     Insert Intention Locks -- intention is to insert into middle of index     
  g. Show Innodb status
     https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html
     In the command, look at the section "Semaphores", "transactions",
     "Last foriegn key error", and others. Locks mya appear in any section. 
     1. Show innodb engine mutex --- displays InnoDB mutex and rw-lock statistics.
       and https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/monitor-innodb-mutex-waits-performance-schema.html
