		and make keeep alived script with read_only and alerts
   make your own vip in linux. 
SkySQL versus other cloud, aws, acure, gcp
Docker with Windows, with Linux, and docker in docker

0. Artcile with just links,
   percona vs oracle vs mariadb, db ratings
     versions of mysql and why they are inmportant
   different replication
   clustering
   sharding
   HA, failover, backup, recovery
   Modern tools for monitoring and graphing - nagios, graophite, graohana, percona, AWS extended, Google Gcp?, datadog
   Certficiation, with linux certification, AWS, GCP, Python, etc. 
1. kcomposer and ispell. [s[ad and download spell chjcker,
