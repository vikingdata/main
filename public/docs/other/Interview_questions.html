<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mysql"></a>MySQL</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Many issues upgrading old MySQL to newer MySQL
    <ul>
      <li>The upgrade path may be long if upgrading a very old version to new version.
      <li>Character sets may change: datetime, timestp, UTF etc. Check notes.
      <li>Some upgrades required a table check and rebuild. Once done, take a backup of it
	and restore for other slaves or master, etc.
      <li>Replication usually only works from previous version. Replications settings
	may also have changed. Do not replicate from newer version to older version ever. 
      <li>Config, query words, etc may have changed or been depreciated.
      <li>Other things may have changed, like passwords, authentication, SQL strict mode.
      <li>Query plans mys have changes, or queries on the new version may behave differently.
      <li>Queries may return different results.

  <li> Disadvantages and advantages and potential problems with Table Partitioning.
    <ul> 
      <li> Bad queries without using using the field for partitioning can scan all partitions.
      <li> If you do use only one partition, but not an index, it it scan the whole partition.
      <li>Cannot foreign keys, full test indexes, use Declared variables, user variables, stored procedures, stored functions, loadable functions, plugins.
      <li>DDL changes may cause locks. Lock the table for any reason is bad.
      <li>Each partition is really its own table. This can affect
	open table cache, open files, buffers for each table, etc.

    </ul>
    
  <li>Galera Scalability
    <ul>
      <li> Galera is vertical scaling, config, load balancing, cache etc but it is NOT
	  good at horizontal scaling.
      <li> Add a cache, like Redis or other cache. 
      <li>More powerful systems --- only goes so far
      <li>Optimize queries, config, etc
      <li>Relax config options to prevent nodes getting kicked out. 
      <li> Add more nodes: This is controversial.
      <li>Make sure you are using fast Ethernet cards, fast IO, and lots of memory to hold
	  data. You want more memory in case another node fails. It then has to hold more
	  data in ram. 
      <li>Add proper load balancing with detection of hot nodes.
	  Have all writes go to one node.
      <li> Use a MySQL slave off one of the those for time insensitive queries for ETL queries./
      <li>Add node which takes no queries for backups.

  <li> MySQL Scaling. 
    <ul>
      <li>None
	<ul>
	  <li>Oracle Fabric: not a fan of. It has had issues and nobody uses it. 
	</ul>
	
      <li> ALL
	<ul>
	  <li>SkySQL -- service.
	    <li>MaxScale : Each system must have a unique database name. 
	  <li>Optimize queries, config, system config, use the correct table engine.
	  <li>Delete data no longer needed and remove data to archive.
	  <li> PlanetScale: I never used this.
	  <li>NDB engine, but everyone has problems making this scale.
	    <li>Shard-query : More for big OLAP queries and not normal OLTP.
	      <li>ProxySQL : Different sharding techniques have limitations. 
	</ul>
	
      <li> Horizontal Reads
	<ul>
	  <li>Add more slaves or nodes.
	  <li>Caching is scalable with Redis or other.
	  <li>Load balancing can help so that one slave is not over used.
	  <li>Table partitioning is sort of vertical scaling. 
	  <li> Software Sharding. 
	</ul>
	
      <li> Vertical Reads
	<ul>
	  <li>More powerful systems
	</ul>

      <li> Vertical Writes. 
	<ul>
	  <li>More powerful systems. 
	</ul>

      <li> Horizontal Writes
	<ul>
	  <li> Software sharing. Shard by mod, by lookup key, or other. 
	    <li> 
	  <li>Limited scalability with Galera Cluster.
