    The purpose of this document is to show how to do window functions. It is also to stop people
    from asking this in interviews as it is very lame and really just
    a set of functions in MySQL.
    Are we expected to remember all functions?
    Yes according to lame people who make lame tests. And yes because some interviews
    will always have those people. 
    There is so much with MySQL this is only small part. The reason why it is lame is non-DBAs
    love to ask about these functions because they don't understand its lame
    and they want to make themselves feel superior. People look at things to ask about MySQL
    on the internet because they know nothing usually and want to feel superior. So I hope
    someone can get use of this.
    <p>
      A lot of the explanations are too complicated. Its really simple.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="do"></a>What window functions do.</h2>
Window functioning is when you take any group function and display the same
result in more than one
line. Normally in a valid query the results are shown one result per line. 
This is true for previous groups functions and what they call Window Functions. I think
the name Window Functions is bad.

    <p>
      With window functions, it really just allows you to show the results of the same grouped
      result on multiple lines. For example, I want to show the entire sum of money
      for each state, and everybody in the state. I want to show one person per line and the
      repeating sum of money the person is on that state.
      Thus, the group function is calculated
      and displayed for each person in the state. Normally the sum the money for a state
      us displayed on one line.
      The state and then the sum. But with window functions you can apply
      the result of the sum to more than one line --- For each person in the state. An example
      is shown below plus more window functions. 
    <p> Why can this be bad? It might be bad because it has to calculate the sums, and then
      redo the results with the sum in multiple lines. This might cause it so be slower.
      I think they optimize this, but I am sure in some cases it can slow things down.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="setup"></a>MySQL setup</h2>
Issue these queries in MySQL prompt
<pre>

  create database if not exists temp;
  use temp;
  drop database if exists MY_STUPID_DATABASE;

  create database if not exists MY_STUPID_DATABASE;
  use MY_STUPID_DATABASE;
  
  create table income (person varchar(64), state varchar(64), amount int);
  insert into income values ('mark', 'CA', 10), ('john', 'CA', 20), ('heidi','CA', 30),
  ('Melisa', 'MA', 100), ('Faith', 'MA', 200),('Queen', 'MA', 300),
  ('Collin', 'IN', 51), ('Tristan', 'OH', 61),('John', 'MA', 71);

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="functions"></a>
Window Functioning made with normal (any) group command
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/aggregate-functions.html
</ul>

Any group command can be made into function like window functions. You have to use partitions.
    <p>
      For example: <pre>
	SELECT person, state, SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY state) as state_income
        FROM income;

	SELECT person, state, count(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY state) as state_no_of_entries
	FROM income;
      </pre>

  SELECT person, state, amount,
