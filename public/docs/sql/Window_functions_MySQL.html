    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId909994"></a>SQL: Window Functions</h1>
    The purpose of this document is to show how to do window functions. It is also to stop people
    from asking this in interviews as it is very lame and really just
    a set of functions in MySQL.
    Are we expected to remember all functions?
    Yes according to lame people who make lame tests. And yes because some interviews
    will always have those people. 
    There is so much with MySQL this is only small part. The reason why it is lame is non-DBAs
    love to ask about these functions because they don't understand its lame
    and they want to make themselves feel superior. People look at things to ask about MySQL
    on the internet because they know nothing usually and want to feel superior. So I hope
    someone can get use of this.
    <p>
      A lot of the explanations are too complicated. Its really simple.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="do"></a>What window functions do.</h2>
Window functions allow you to show calculations after all the data has been read into the
query for group functions.
Normally queries read the data all when a group function in in the query, each group
calculation as one line according to what it not grouped. Such as all the income for every State
in the USA 
is shown as the State's name and its sum one line each. Ordering is just ordering of the final
result. It doesn't change the result.

    <p>
      With window functions, it really just allows you to show the results of the same grouped
      result on multiple lines. 4For example, I want to show the entire sum of money
      for each state, and everybody in the state. I want to show one person per line and the
      repeating sum of money the person is on that state. Thus, The group function is calculated
      and displayed for each person in the state. Normally is the sum the money for a state
      in it one one line. The state and then the sum. But with window functions you can apply
      the result of the sum to more than one line --- For each person in the state. An example
      is shown below plus more window functions.

Window Functioning made with normal (any) group command
</h2>
Any group command can be made into function like window functions. You have to use partitions.
    <p>
      For example: <pre>  SELECT person, state, SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY state) as state_income
      FROM my_table;</pre>
