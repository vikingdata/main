    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId909994"></a>SQL: Window Functions</h1>
    The purpose of this document is to show how to do window functions. It is also to stop people
    from asking this in interviews as it is very lame and really just
    a set of functions in MySQL.
    Are we expected to remember all functions?
    Yes according to lame people who make lame tests. And yes because some interviews
    will always have those people. 
    There is so much with MySQL this is only small part. The reason why it is lame is non-DBAs
    love to ask about these functions because they don't understand its lame
    and they want to make themselves feel superior. People look at things to ask about MySQL
    on the internet because they know nothing usually and want to feel superior. So I hope
    someone can get use of this.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="do"></a>What window functions do.</h2>
Window functions allow you to show calculations after all the data has been read into the
query. Normally queries read the data as is and cannot order and group the data until the
end of the query. Data is scanned once and they group or ordered. You cannot normally show
the results of a grouped function until all the rows have been grouped.
    <p>
      With window functions, it really just allows you to show the results of the grouped
      commands with each line of data. For example, I want to show the entire sum of money
      for each state, and everybody in the state. I want to show one person per line and the
      repeating sum of money the person is on that state. Thus, The group function is calculated
      and displayed for each person in the state. Normally is the sum the money for a state
      in it one one line. The state and then the sum. But with window functions you can apply
      the result of the sum to more than one line. For each person in the state. An example
      is shown below plus more window functions.
