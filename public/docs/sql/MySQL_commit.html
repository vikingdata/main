    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId909994"></a>SQL: MySQL commit</h1>
The purpose of this document is to show to commit data (schema or data) in  production

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId514232"></a>No Links</h2>
No links, this article is stuff I have used in production before. 

<br><hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="general"></a>General steps.</h2>
These are high level steps. We aren't going to go into details with each one. 

<ol>
  <li>There is a written procedure and policy for data or schema changes to databases. 
<li>Ticket changes in the system capture all below. 
  <li>DEV: Development proposes changes that work.
  <li>QA tests the changes
  <li>A 2nd pair of eyes approves the changes from a technical point of view.
  <li>A manager or business or other person accepts the changes.
  <li>Changes have to be scheduled and approved. All dangers and backup plans must
    be presented.
  <li>Follow procedures to execute changes in prod.
  <li>Make sure all changes are recorded.
  <li>Post error logs to ticket and report in ticket the outcome.
  <li> If successful, close ticket.
  <li> If not, follow procedures or rollback based on policy.
  <li> Database changes and application software upgradea should happen on different
    days if possible, and not on Fridays or weekends if possible. 
</ol>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="setup"><a>Setup</h2>

Execute in the mysql shell
<pre>
  create database if not exists My_STUPID_DATABASE;
  use MY_STUPID_DATABASE;
  
  create table if not exists people (id int,  name varchar(64));
  create table if not exists charges (id int, int amount);
  insert into people (1, 'mark'), (2, 'john'), (3, 'you');
  insert into charges (1, 10), (2,10), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2,5);
</pre>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="techniques">Commit techniques</a></h2>
<h3> Source sql file</h3>
You can do it one of two ways:
<ul>
  <li>In the mysql prompt "source FILE.sql" will execute commands in the file and keep going even if there are errors.
  <li> Or "cat FILE.sql | mysql" with mysql options will submit commands to mysql. It should stop on the first error.
</ul>

You must be careful with either solutions. Lets assume all the commands work.
Should log all commands. In general
<uL>
  <li> mysql should be executed as "mysql -v -v -v"
  <li> The first commands should be <pre>
      tee error.log
      use database DB;
      select now(), @@hostname, USER();
      begin;

      # Your commands, not schema changes.

      commit;
    </pre>
    <li>Analyze the error log with "grep -i err error.log" and look for any errors. NOTE: you may get false errors. 
    <li> Feel free is to discuss your own requirements. 
</ul>

Doing it this is either way you need to be careful of:
<ol>
  <li>Any schema changes. They can commit changes and also cause locks. 
  <li>Data or schema changes may lock queries.
  <li>Data or schema changes can use of diskspace.
  <li> It might be wise to break up sql files to commit to data and schema separetly and
    to do a different sql file for each ticket. 
</ol>

<h4>Online DDL Operations</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html">Online DDL Operations</a>
</ul>

Some schema changes can be made without locking, without creating a new table, and does not block queries.
Different versions of MySQL allow different DDL operations without hassle.
However, the operations my slow down the system. Online DDL Operations is used a lot
and very benefincial and can be combined with the sql change files.

<h4> Percona online schema changes</h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/3.0/pt-online-schema-change.html">pt-online-schema-change</a>
Percona online schema change creates a temporary new table, populates the new table, use triggers to make the new identical the same as the old with the changes, and then
swaps the tables, and usually deletes the now old table.
</ul>
<p>
  This technique can be used for almost all schama changes. There are some
  exceptions, like if triggers exist. Also, some versions make only work with some
  versions of MySQL. 
<p>
  This is used a lot and be used with sql change files.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="sample"></a>Sample Steps</h2>
We will do the following:
<ol>
  <li> Create a new table.
  <li>Add data in a commit block.
  <li>Use online shcme change to change table.
  <li>Lock a table with a schema change.
  <li>Use pt-schema-change to all auto increment and indexes.
</ol>
