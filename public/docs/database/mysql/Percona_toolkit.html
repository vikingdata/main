    This is just about using the toolkit with MySQL. Another article will cover the use
    with MongoDB. Also, this toolkit can be used in the cloud, and sometimes DaaS with AWS RDS.
    Also, the toolkit may have changed after this article was made. I might update this
    article once a year.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="tools"></a>Tools</h2>

Most used tools
<ul>
  <li>pt-online-schema-change : If you have never used this a DBA, practice it.
    Even though you have inline schema changes which don't lock tables, not everything
    is lock free in MySQL. This tool is vital for schema changes in prod without
    downtime and being safe. I highly recommend this tool. 
  <li>percona ExtraBackup: Not part of the toolset but I am including because it
    is not usefu. This tool is VERY VERY useful for making backups. It doesn't
    block the server. It will slow down the IO. This tools also makes it easy to restore a server. It is saved in binary format, so copy it to the new server in the data
    directory, and making a few changes like accounts and replication you can restore
    the server quickly (as soon as all the files are transferred). There is also
    lots of other nice features to many to mention here (like encryption). 
    <br>NOTE: You should get the BINLOG position on the master AND slave if you are backing
    up the slave. If you use a slave, add "--slave-info". Even though it says slave
    info, you are recording the binlog info of the master (because this is a slave).
    Thus you can restore this as a slave of the original master, or as a slave
    to the server you ran this program on (effectively a slave of a slave). This
    command is usefil if you want to replicate to the original master when restored. 
  <li>pt-query-digest : I recommend this tool. But there are other tools to use
    to make slow reports. I made one 10 years ago that didn't a better job than
    ANY slow log report from any tool. They miss one important concept. 
  <li>pt-table-checksum : I use this a lot just to see if there are differences.
    <br>NOTE: I think this doesn't tell you the primary keys of which tables are different.
    Just the numbers of rows that are different. I wrote a python script
    back in 2008 which tells you the exact rows by primary key or unique index
    which is not the same -- quickly with low impact. It had other
    capabilities. I made it VERY VERY easy to sync the servers. Better than pt-sync
    in my opinion.
  <li>pt-sync
    <br>NOTE: If there is valid data on the Slave, this will destory it. Get data off the slave before running this.
      <br>How can data get on the slave? Replication errors and the person whoistarted replication let the last command fly. Someone logged in as root and made changes. There are multiple
      masters for this server --- this can be dangerous if so. An application wrote to the slave
      when it should not of -- did you turn read the global read-only variable?
</ul>
<p>
  Useful tools you will probably ned to use. This is ONLY my preference. You may
  find some of these tools useful for yourself that I don't. 
<ul>
  <li>pt-index-usage : This can be useful to run queries from a log to analyze how queries
    use the indexes. This can be used for debuggin.
  <li>pt-diskstats
    <br>NOTE: For debugging why a query isn't working, I look at disk IO and space, memory
    and memory config for MySQL, cpu usage, load, network speed and latancy and hitting
    a bottleneck, account permissions, and others things. A complete tool or set of tools
    is desired. 
</ul> 
<p>
Less Used tools

<ul>
  <li> pt-archiver : You can do this manually with a cronjob. You don't need this. But its nice.
  <li>pt-config-diff : Less useful if you have automated installs. But it can be used to check
    servers for alarms. If someone changes things, you want to know about it.
  <li>pt-duplicate-key-checker : When trying to optimize tables, removing useless
    indexes might be nice. Run this as an alarm every in a while and not at night. 
  <li>pt-heartbeat : Look at pacemaker.
  <li>pt-kill : Very nice program. For me I generally don't need it. What I do is writes
    a python program which shows the highest time on queries first,
    or use Solar Winds or Relic or another tool, 
    or use this bash command just to quickly scan the processlist:
    <pre>
     echo PASSWORD="bad_password"  
     mysql -u root -p$PASSWORD -e "show full processlist" | grep -i "sleep" | less
    </pre>
  <li>pt-mysql-summary : Nice and useful for reports, but doesn't have everything
    I want. 
</ul>
