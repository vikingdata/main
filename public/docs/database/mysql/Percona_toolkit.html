    <h1><a class="mozTocH1" name="mozTocId909994"></a>Percona Toolkit : Most command uses with MySQL</h1>
    <center><i><b>by Mark Nielsen<br>Copyright Dec 2021</b></i></center>
    This is just about using the toolkit with MySQL. Another article will cover the use
    with MongoDB. Also, this toolkit can be used in the cloud, and sometimes DaaS with AWS RDS.
    Also, the toolkit may have changed after this article was made. I might update this
    article once a year.

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="tools"></a>Tools</h2>

Most used tools
<ul>
  <li>pt-online-backup
  <li>pt-checksum
    <br>NOTE: This doesn't tell you the primary keys of which tables are different.
    Just the numbers of rows that are different. 
  <li>pt-sync
    <br>NOTE: If there is valid data on the Slave, this will destory it. Get data off the slave before running this.
      <br>How can data get on the slave? Replication errors and the person whoistarted replication let the last command fly. Someone logged in as root and made changes. There are multiple
      masters for this server --- this can be dangerous if so. An application wrote to the slave
      when it should not of -- did you turn read the global read-only variable?
</ul>
<p>
Useful tools you will probably ned to use.
<ul>
  <li>pt-index-usage : This can be useful to run queries from a log to analyze how queries
    use the indexes. This can be used for debuggin.
  <li>pt-diskstats
    <br>NOTE: For debugging why a query isn't working, I look at disk IO and space, memory
    and memory config for MySQL, cpu usage, load, network speed and latancy and hitting
    a bottleneck, account permissions, and others things. A complete tool or set of tools
    is desired. 
</ul> 
<p>
Less Uses tools

<ul>
  <li> pt-archiver : You can do this manually with a cronjob. You don't need this. But its nice.
  <li>pt-config-diff : Less useful if you have automated installs. But it can be used to check
    servers for alarms. If someone changes things, you want to know about it.
</ul>
