    <center><h1>MySQL Backup and Restore</h1></center>
    <center><i><b>by Mark Nielsen<br>Copyright 2021</b></i></center><br><br>
    This should cover  mysqldump, xtrabackup, binary,
    snaphots via LVM or KVM, mariabackup but not anything to do with the Cloud. 
    <p>In general, here is a breakdown of the different backups.
      <ul>
	<li>ALL: If made right all can be compressed and encrypted. All can be done non-locking
	  or sub second downtime. I recommend to always backup on a slave. I always recommend
	  to compare data from Master to the Slave, like using Percona pt-table-checksum.
	<li>mysqldump, xtrabackup, and mariabackup and maybe snapshots can do incremental
	  backups. 
	<li>MySQLDump: The dump is text. If there is an error in the dump you can
	  edit it diretly. Easy to compress. But takes a long time for the backup to run
	  and restore. Can be impractical for large databases.
	<li> xtrabackup and mariabackup: One is for Percona and the other for MariaDB.
	  It creates a binary backup for quick restore. Can include binlog of master or slave
	  if you backup from a master ot slave. Can error out easier than other backups methods
	  but usually never causes a problem and is the most widely used default when setup
	  correctly. I highly recommend using a Slave. 
	<li>Binary: Its a hard backup. You do not need any software. But you should shut down
	  the server. Its better to use snapshots. Snapshots are the same as Binary backups
	  for the most part.
	<li>Snapshot: Very similar to binary backups. However the snapshot is an ENTIRE filesystem.
	  If you take a snapshot and then do a binary backup of mysql only it is effectively
	  the same as a binary backup. The big advantage here is there is little downtime.
	  The amount of downtime is basically the time it is to setup the snapshot which is
	  normally quick. Thus, always use on a Slave decidated for backups or one you take
	  out of your load balancer. It will use a lot of IO if you are making a copy of the
	  snaphot to a backup device.
