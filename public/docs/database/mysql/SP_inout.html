  MySQL stored procedures are easy to understand once you follow the simple rules for
  IN and OUT.
  <ol>
    <li> IN requires there to be an input. 
    <li>OUT requires you to have output in the charater type defined. HINT: you should
      force a conversation or possibly error out.
    <li> INOUT requires and input and it prints an output.
  </ol>

  <h1>MySQL Stored Procedures</h1>
  Create these stored procedure in mysql.
  <p>
    Remember these important tips. Lets take the variable VAR1. It can be
    confusing to remmeber when to use "@VAR1" or "VAR1" at times. 
    <ol>
      <li>Whenever you "read" or "select" the variable VAR1 you must use "@VAR1"". This applies to the mysql shell or in stored procedures. 
      <li>Whenever you set VAR1 in the mysql shells, you must use "@VAR1".
      <li>Whenevr you set, or declare, or use in proc_parameters (IN, OUT, INOUT) VAR1 in a stored procedure, you must use "VAR1".
    </ol>
  <p>
    Simple function. 
<pre>
<!--#include virtual="create_sp.sql" -->
</pre>
<h1>IN example</h1>
IN variables can be static or environment variables. They are only used in the
stored procedure. If any evironment variable is used, it is not changed when the stored procedure ends. 

<pre>
<!--#include virtual="i.out" -->
</pre>

<h1>OUT and INOUT example</h1>
The important thing to remember about OUT defined variables are:
<ol>
  <li> If the variable in the mysql environment exists, it is set to NULL.
  <li> A variable must be submitted to an OUT defined input.
  <li>A variable submitted to an OUT input variable will be references
    and NOT copied. This means any changes to the variable will appear in the envionment
    submitted to the procedures.
    </ol>
  <p>
    For OUT, We see the @i1 variable is submitted as "1" to the stored procedure. We see
    the sp immediately makes it NULL. At the end it changes it to "3" and
    the environment variables @i1 becomes "3".
  <p>
    For INOUT, @i2 is submitted as "2". It does not change upon entering. It s changed to
    "4" and then the environment variable is changed. 
<pre>
<!--#include virtual="o.out" -->
