    <i><b>by Mark Nielsen<br>Copyright August 2021</b></i></center><br><br>
   You can install Mongo from scratch and also upgrade Mong in thie document.
   In general, if you go the upgrade path, you have to be careful to not jump with
   upgrades to far. Check the version upgrade documentation.

Weird stuff I experiences or heard of:
<ul>
  <li> MMAPv1 storage engine no longer is in the latest versions. However, I worked
    in a project to explain why Mongo was slower with the new engine and version of
    MySQL. So I timed the process with the different storage engines and found out a
    single thread processing a lot of data was faster under MMAPv1 storage engine
    than WiredTiger. A single process may be slower in WireTiger but WiredTiger handles
    mutiple processes much better (locking and other). Still they didn't like I didn't
    make it faster even though I found out why. They just wanted the upgraded version
    for political reasons. I stay away from politics.
  <li>In an interview, a person asked how to can get lost data. They were pointing at
    misharding or putting data in the wrong shard and so it remains invisible. But they
    there are other ways. If there is a imperfect failover in a replica set some data
    may be stored in the "rollback" directory. They didn't like I had better answers
    than they did. Its bad in an interview to correct the interviewer. Its often better
    to answer that they want to hear than being correct. <p>
