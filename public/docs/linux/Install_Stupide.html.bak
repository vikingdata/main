    This is not going to be a full installation tutorial. Its just how I installed Linux Mint on
    my laptop. I had problems. I will leave the normal full installation steps to the
    normal webopages. I felt it was important to record this stupidity.A

Of course most laptop makers mostly ignore Linux which makes life hard for real
computer geeks. Here is the stuff I had to do.

<ol>
  <li> Downkloaded iso : https://mirrors.sonic.net/mint/isos/stable/20.3/linuxmint-20.3-mate-64bit.iso
  <li>Windows, right clicked on iso and burned DVD.
    <li>In laptop, pressed f12 to get to the configuration of the laptop. 
    <li> Changed to boot off of DVD first. Then change the storage controller from RAID
      to the other one. Why have raid on a single disk laptop when 99.9% of laptops never use
      raid, I don't know. Turned off the secure boot.
    <li>Now Windoze won't boot. It was probably because I disabled raid. B
      I undid everything but keep secure boot off.
    <li>Realized in Linux Mint installation I had to turn of Windows Biut Locker, which
      I can turn back on probably after installtion.
    <li>Undid almost everything but safe boot in the BIOS.
    <li>Windows is now the default, but I can select single boot off the DVD in the future.
    <li>Got into Windoze and turned off bitlocker. But this took a while to decrypt
      everything. 
    <li> Restarted and got back into Linux Mint. Installed Linux Mint.
      <li>The MBR now lets me select Windoze or Linux Mint at boot time. 
</ol>
