    <center><i><b>by Mark Nielsen<br>Copyright 2021</b></i></center><br><br>
    This is not going to be a full installation tutorial. Its just how I installed Linux Mint on
    my laptop. I had problems. I will leave the normal full installation steps to the
    normal webpages. I felt it was important to record this stupidity.A

Of course most laptop makers mostly ignore Linux which makes life hard for real
computer geeks. Here is the stuff I had to do.

<ol>
  <li> Downloaded ISO : https://mirrors.sonic.net/mint/isos/stable/20.3/linuxmint-20.3-mate-64bit.iso
  <li>Windows, right clicked on ISO and burned DVD.
    <li>In laptop, pressed f12 to get to the configuration of the laptop. 
    <li> Changed to boot off of DVD first. Then change the storage controller from RAID
      to the other one. Why have raid on a single disk laptop when 99.9% of laptops never use
      raid, I don't know. Turned off the secure boot.
    <li>Now Windoze won't boot. It was probably because I disabled raid. B
      I undid everything but keep secure boot off.
    <li>Realized in Linux Mint installation I had to turn of Windows Bit Locker, which
      I can turn back on probably after installation.
    <li>Undid almost everything but safe boot in the BIOS.
    <li>Windows is now the default, but I can select single boot off the DVD in the future.
    <li>Got into Windoze and turned off bitlocker. But this took a while to decrypt
      everything. It took hours to decrypt.
    <li>I went back to turn off VMD config and used the older hard drivers. This made Windows
      non bootable. To heck with it. I will just delete the partitions. 
      <li>Linux Mint didn't have the drivers to use VMD for storage, so I used Ubuntu MATE. 
    <li> In
      <li>The MBR now lets me select Windoze or Linux Mint at boot time. 
</ol>

I could have done the Ubuntu Mate install, but it wouldn't run, It was very slow. Also,
you have to choose a good password for LinuxMint or it might not set the password and you won't
be able to login in.
    <p>
      Here is a trick to take care of the password.
      <ul>
	<li> Boot off the cdrom.
	<li>Opwn terminal.
	<li> Go to root: su -l bash or sudo bash
	<li> adduser mark --- and set the password
	<li>mount the drive from the hard drive which was /dev/sda2: <pre>mkdir -p /mnt/2
	    mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/2</pre>
	<li>Look at /etc/shadow and copy the line for "mark" into /mnt/2/etc/shadow for th user mark. You can use vi.
	<li>unmount the drive: umount /mnt/2
	  <li>Reboot and your password was changed.


	</ul>
